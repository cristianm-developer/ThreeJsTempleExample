# React + Three.js Interactive Showcase

This project is a **React** + **Three.js (via @react-three/fiber)** playground focused on experimenting with modern real-time 3D rendering techniques to create **high-quality, attractive and interactive visual experiences**.

The goal is to document and showcase a collection of techniques that can be used to elevate the visual fidelity and interactivity of web-based 3D scenes.

## âœ¨ Features and Techniques

- **HDRIs & Environment Cubemaps**  
  Lighting and reflections using high-dynamic-range environments for realistic visuals.

- **Real-Time Reflections**  
  Reflective surfaces enhanced with cubemaps and mixed techniques.

- **Custom GLSL Shaders**  
  Extending and editing Three.js materials using custom fragment/vertex shader chunks.

- **Scene Importing**  
  Loading complex environments (e.g., GLTF / GLB) and integrating them into interactive compositions.

- **Interactive Lighting**  
  Lights that react in real time to user input and scene events.

- **Event-Driven Effects**  
  Interaction hooks (mouse, pointer, keyboard, time) to trigger dynamic visual responses.
